Fern's third generation will move using gyroscopic control. I hope this will add a sense of wonder and curiosity for observers beyond the physical drawing.

The basis of this design is the conservation of angular momentum. Instead of driving two linear axis, Fern will have spinning joints to imitate a swinging arm.
